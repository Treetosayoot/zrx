/// Store delta behavior.
///
/// When creating chunks of items from a stream of items, we sometimes need to
/// convert this to deltas of items, i.e., items representing the changes in the
/// store. This trait allows to compute deltas for a store after applying a set
/// of changes, emitting the insertions and deletions that were made.
///
/// __Warning__: Implementations are expected to consolidate the inputs sourced
/// from the iterator, so only the last instance from the iterator is persisted
/// If inputs are not consolidated, deltas of items with duplicate keys may be
/// yielded, which might lead to unnecessary computations.
