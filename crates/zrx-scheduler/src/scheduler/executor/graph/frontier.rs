///
/// The storage only contains values that are still needed, i.e. the values of
/// nodes that have not been visited yet. Dependencies are tracked, so that if
/// all dependencies of a node (i.e. an action) have been resolved, the value
/// is removed from the storage, as it is no longer needed.
