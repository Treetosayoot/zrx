/// Action property.
///
/// Properties describe certain characteristics of an [`Action`][] which affect
/// how the scheduler might optimize its execution, including handling of side
/// effects. By default, no properties are assumed, instructing the scheduler
/// to be conservative, i.e., safe but not optimal.
///
/// __Warning__: Always make sure that the assumed properties actually hold, or
/// execution can yield undefined behavior, e.g., assuming [`Property::Flush`]
/// for an action that emits deltas of items. Thus, always thoroughly check
/// the description and constraints of the property before assuming it.
///

    /// Action is pure.
    ///
    /// An action is considered pure if it consistently produces the same output
    /// for the same input, which basically means the absence of internal state.
    /// It can, of course, return effects like [`Task`][] and [`Timer`][] to
    /// defer execution, as long as results are consistent.

    ///
    /// An action is considered stable if it always produces outputs with the
    /// same identifiers as the inputs it got. This allows the [`Scheduler`][]
    /// to optimize execution by using simpler synchronization primitives that
    /// require less memory and compute resources.

    /// Action is flushing.
    ///
    /// An action is considered flushing if its output is always self-contained.
    /// This allows the scheduler to interrupt any active executions, as their
    /// outputs will be superseded by new inputs. Assuming this property for
    /// outputs that are not self-contained leads to lost emissions.
