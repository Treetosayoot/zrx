/// Conversion into [`Error`].
///
/// This trait is solely provided for [`IntoReport`][], which makes use of it
/// to conveniently convert any error type into [`Error`]. This is particularly
/// useful when it comes to user-provided functions that may return any kind of
/// error, as this trait ensures those errors are downcasted accordingly.
///
/// [`IntoReport`]: crate::scheduler::action::report::IntoReport
pub trait IntoError {
    /// Converts into an action error.
    ///
    /// This method is used to convert any error type into an [`Error`]. As of
    /// now, the only errors that receive special treatment are errors of type
    /// [`io::Error`][], as they're common and we can handle them more easily.
    /// All other errors are converted into the [`Error::Other`] variant.
    ///
    /// Note that [`Error::Value`] is deliberately not handled, so it would be
    /// converted to [`Error::Other`] as well, since we use this error variant
    /// for fine-grained control of the scheduler. In fact, [`Error::Value`]
    /// is only intended for internal use, but still an action error.
