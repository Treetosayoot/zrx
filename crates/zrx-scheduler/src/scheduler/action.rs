/// Action.
///
/// Actions represent units of work that can be executed by a [`Scheduler`][],
/// and which can hold state between executions, which is also why the execution
/// of an action requires a mutable reference to the action. Any data passed to
/// and returned from an action needs to be type-erased.
///
/// Implementors can embed types into the implementation of the action, which
/// can use the [`TryFromValues`][] trait to convert [`Values`][] contained in
/// the [`Input`] into the expected types. The scheduler as such only ensures
/// the correct order of execution, not the type safety of the data. Downstream
/// actions can receive data from multiple upstream actions, which allows to
/// model complex workflows using a [`Graph`][], created with a [`Builder`][]
/// that is provided to aid in graph construction, representing the workflow of
/// actions. Note that actions themselves are not aware of the structure of the
/// underlying graph they're part of, which is why the [`Builder`][] helps to
/// ensure type safety and coherence.
///
/// [`Builder`]: crate::scheduler::graph::Builder
/// [`Graph`]: crate::scheduler::graph::Graph
/// [`Scheduler`]: crate::scheduler::Scheduler
