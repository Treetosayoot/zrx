/// Identifier.
///
/// This trait defines the requirements for identifiers, which are the central
/// means of identifying inputs and outputs of actions, as well as frontiers in
/// the scheduler. For instance, two [`Item`][] values with the same identifier
/// are part of the same frontier, which is essential for joins and more.
///
/// Identifiers are required to implement [`Eq`], [`Hash`] and [`Ord`], as they
/// might be stored in stateful operators, whereas [`Display`] and [`Debug`] are
/// required for tracing and debugging purposes. Of course, identifiers must be
/// [`Send`] to be usable in worker threads. Every type that implements all of
/// those traits can be used as an identifier in the scheduler, as we provide
/// a blanket implementation of this trait.
///
/// We assume that identifiers are cheap to clone, so the use of [`Arc`][] is
/// strongly recommended when using string-based identifiers.
///
/// __Warning__: The `'static` lifetime which is required by this trait is a
/// deliberate design choice to simplify passing data to threads. If we would
/// not require the lifetime, we would need to add a lifetime parameter to all
/// types consuming this trait, which is cumbersome to use.
///
/// [`Arc`]: std::sync::Arc
/// [`Item`]: crate::scheduler::effect::Item
