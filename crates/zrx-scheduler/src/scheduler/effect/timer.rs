/// Timer.
///
/// This data type is used to set, reset, or clear a timer. However, it doesn't
/// set a timer directly, but rather encapsulates a set of [`Outputs`] together
/// with an instruction to the scheduler when and whether to handle the outputs.
/// Thus, a [`Timer`] must be returned to be considered for activation.
///
/// In order to make creation of timers more convenient, this module provides
/// the [`IntoInstant`] and [`IntoDuration`] conversion traits, which can be
/// used to pass something that can be converted into a duration to an action,
/// and then be passed to the [`Timer`] methods.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use zrx_scheduler::action::Outputs;
/// use zrx_scheduler::effect::{Item, Timer};
///
/// // Create outputs
/// let outputs = Outputs::from(Item::new("id", Some(42)));
///
/// // Create timer to delay outputs by 100ms
/// let timer = Timer::set(100, Some(outputs));
/// ```
#[derive(Debug)]
pub enum Timer<I> {
    /// Timer should be set, but not reset.
    ///
    /// If the scheduler already received a previous timer from an action, only
    /// the [`Outputs`] will be replaced, if any, or set to nothing. This allows
    /// to implement operators like `audit` and `throttle`, where the time frame
    /// stays the same, but the [`Outputs`] can change any time.
    ///
    /// [`Timer::Set`] is special in that once its data was set to [`None`], it
    /// won't accept any further data, which is required to block emissions.
    Set {
        /// Emission deadline.
        deadline: Instant,
        /// Outputs to emit, if any.
        data: Option<Outputs<I>>,
    },

    /// Timer should always be reset.
    ///
    /// This variant will always reset an existing timer, allowing to implement
    /// operators like `debounce`, where the latest emission is only emitted if
    /// there were no new emissions within the given time frame. [`Outputs`] of
    /// previous emissions are dropped.
    Reset {
        /// Emission deadline.
        deadline: Instant,
        /// Outputs to emit, if any.
        data: Option<Outputs<I>>,
    },

    /// Timer should be repeated.
    ///
    /// This is equivalent to [`Timer::set`], except for that it requires the
    /// presence of a [`Duration`] instead of an [`Instant`], as the scheduler
    /// should automatically repeat the timer without interaction from actions.
    /// Additionally, the duration can be changed in a subsequent emission.
    Repeat {
        /// Emission interval.
        interval: Duration,
