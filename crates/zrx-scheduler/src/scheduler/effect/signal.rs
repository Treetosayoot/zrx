/// Signal.
///
/// Signals allow to pass system messages to an [`Action`][], which in turn can
/// emit one or more [`Output`][] values in response, similar to how items are
/// handled, but with the added flexibility of being able to react to system
/// state changes or user-defined barriers.
///
/// This enum is marked as non-exhaustive, so new variants can be added in the
/// future without breaking existing downstream code, especially if signals are
/// ignored, which is recommended for most cases, since only some actions are
/// expected to react to signals in a meaningful way.
///
/// [`Action`]: crate::scheduler::action::Action
/// [`Output`]: crate::scheduler::action::Output

#[non_exhaustive]
pub enum Signal<'a, I> {
    /// Identifier submission signal.
    Submit(&'a I),
