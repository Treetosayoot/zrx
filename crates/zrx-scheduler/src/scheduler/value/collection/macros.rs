// Macros
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

/// Creates a value collection from the given expressions.
///
/// This macro conveniently creates [`Values`][] from the provided expressions,
/// each of which is expected to implement the [`Value`][] trait and which can
/// then be passed to actions. Note that this is a low-level API, and in most
/// cases, you will not need to use it directly.
///
/// [`Value`]: crate::scheduler::value::Value
/// [`Values`]: crate::scheduler::value::Values
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use zrx_scheduler::values;
///
/// // Create value collection
/// let values = values!(&1, &2, &3);
/// ```
#[macro_export]
macro_rules! values {
    ($($arg:expr),* $(,)?) => {
        $crate::value::Values::from_iter([
            $(Some($arg as &dyn $crate::value::Value)),*
        ])
    };
