/// Diagnostic.
///
/// Diagnostics are messages that provide information about notable events that
/// occur during the execution of a function. This crate makes it easy to amend
/// and function to include diagnostics by returning an implementation of the
/// [`IntoReport`][] trait.
///
/// There are two primary cases for using diagnostics:
///
/// - __Integration__: By implementing the [`IntoDiagnostic`] trait, any type
///   can be converted into a [`Diagnostic`], which allows for the integration
///   of notable events originating in third-party libraries and tools into the
///   diagnostic system.
///
/// - __Information__: Logging is one of the primary use cases for diagnostics,
///   as it avoids requiring a central facility for logging with global state.
///   The macros [`error!`], [`warning!`] and friends allow to quickly create
///   diagnostics, also capturing location information.
///
/// While all members of this struct are public, there are also some dedicated
/// methods with identical names, providing a builder-like interface.
///
/// [`error!`]: crate::error!
/// [`warning!`]: crate::warning!
/// [`IntoReport`]: crate::diagnostic::report::IntoReport
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use zrx_diagnostic::{Diagnostic, Location, Severity};
///
/// // Create diagnostic
/// let diagnostic =
///     Diagnostic::new(Severity::Error, "File not found")
///         .location(Location::new("path/to/file.rs", (0, 0)))
///         .code(404);
