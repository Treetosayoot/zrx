/// Function adapter to pass the identifier to the function.
///
/// This adapter is just a wrapper around a function and acts as a marker to
/// omit conflicting implementations of function traits with more specialized
/// implementations. This implementation adds an identifier to the function
/// signature, which is necessary in certain contexts.
///
/// Use the [`with_id`] function to wrap a function with this adapter, since
/// this type is not part of the streaming API, as it's only necessary for the
/// implementation of the function traits themselves. See the documentation of
/// [`with_id`] for more information.

    /// Function.
    function: F,

/// Passes the identifier to the function.
///
/// Function traits that implement this trait allow to pass a function that
/// receives the identifier of the item as the first argument. This is useful
/// when the function needs to know the identifier of the item being processed,
/// which is necessary in certain contexts.
///
/// Note that there are no trait bounds, since [`WithId`] is merely a marker
/// struct that is used to differentiate between function implementations. This
/// is also why the returned type implements [`Deref`], so that it behaves like
/// the underlying function.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// # use std::error::Error;
/// # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
/// use zrx_stream::function::{with_id, InspectFn};
///
/// // Define and execute function
/// let f = |&id: &&str, &n: &i32| println!("{id} -> {n}");
/// with_id(f).execute(&"id", &42)?;
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
/// ```

    WithId { function: f }
