/// Executor.
///
/// Executors serve as the primary interface for submitting and monitoring tasks
/// within the system. They act as a frontend to various execution [`Strategy`]
/// implementations, which define how tasks are prioritized and executed. Each
/// execution [`Strategy`] encapsulates an implementation that determines the
/// order and concurrency of execution. Abstracting the execution mechanism
/// allows for flexible and interchangeable task management strategies.
///
/// Additionally, executors implement [`Clone`], which allows to easily share
/// them among different parts of the system without borrowing issues.
///
/// Note that executors are not responsible for managing the lifetime of tasks,
/// as it is assumed that tasks are self-contained and can be run independently.
/// If a [`Task`] is submitted to an executor, it can't be cancelled or stopped,
/// as the executor is not aware of the task's internal state. However, callers
/// can implement fine-grained execution strategies on top of the executor to
/// gain fine-grained control over task execution.
///
/// This is an opinionated implementation that specifically targets the needs of
/// our execution model. It is not meant to be a general-purpose executor.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Create an executor spawning 1,000 tasks using all CPUs - 1:
///
/// ```
/// # use std::error::Error;
/// # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
/// use std::thread;
/// use std::time::Duration;
/// use zrx_executor::strategy::WorkStealing;
/// use zrx_executor::Executor;
///
/// // Create executor with strategy
/// let strategy = WorkStealing::default();
/// let executor = Executor::new(strategy);
///
/// // Create 1,000 tasks taking 20ms each
/// for _ in 0..1000 {
///     executor.submit(|| {
///         thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(20));
///     })?;
/// }
/// # Ok(())
/// # }

    /// This method submits a [`Task`], which is executed by one of the worker
    /// threads as soon as possible. If a task computes a result, a [`Sender`][]
    /// can be shared with the task, to send the result back to the caller,
    /// which can then poll a [`Receiver`][].
    ///
    /// Note that tasks are intended to only run once, which is why they are
    /// consumed. If a task needs to be run multiple times, it must be wrapped
    /// in a closure that creates a new task each time. This allows for safe
    /// sharing of state between tasks.
    ///
    /// [`Receiver`]: crossbeam::channel::Receiver
    /// [`Sender`]: crossbeam::channel::Sender
    ///
    /// # Errors
    ///
    /// If the executor encounters a problem during task submission, it will
    /// forward the encountered error to the caller, returning the task. Most
    /// likely, the underlying execution strategy is at capacity, which means
    /// the caller should resubmit the task at a later time. This is possible,
    /// since this method accepts any type that implements the [`Task`] trait
    /// and converts it into a boxed task.
