/// Execution strategy.
///
/// Besides task submission, strategies must also allow to inspect the number of
/// workers, as well as the number of running and pending tasks, which might be
/// useful for implementing more fine-grained execution strategies. It's also
/// used to determine whether an [`Executor`][] is idle or at capacity.

    /// and in what order tasks are executed, is entirely up to the strategy
    /// implementation.
