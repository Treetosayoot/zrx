/// Task.
///
/// Tasks are units of work that can be submitted to an [`Executor`][], which
/// forwards them for execution to an execution [`Strategy`][] that is set when
/// creating the [`Executor`][]. Moreover, tasks can create and return further
/// [`Tasks`], which are handled by the same execution strategy, allowing for
/// immediate or deferred execution, as implemented by the strategy. If a task
/// panics, it doesn't take the worker thread or executor with it.
///
/// Note that tasks will almost always need to capture environment variables,
/// which is why they're created from [`FnOnce`] and must be [`Send`].
