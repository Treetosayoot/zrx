/// Work-stealing execution strategy.
///
/// This strategy implements work-stealing, where each worker thread has its own
/// local queue. Workers can steal tasks from a central injector or from other
/// workers, if their local queues are empty. This allows for more efficient
/// execution if there's a large number of workers and tasks.
///
/// Work stealing enhances load balancing by allowing idle workers to take on
/// tasks from busier peers, which helps to reduce idle time and can improve
/// overall throughput. Unlike the simpler [`WorkSharing`][] strategy that uses
/// a central queue where workers may become stuck waiting for new tasks, this
/// method can yield better resource utilization. Additionally, work-stealing
/// helps mitigate contention over shared resources (i.e. channels), which can
/// become a bottleneck in central queueing systems, allowing each worker to
/// primarily operate on its local queue. However, if task runtimes are short,
/// the utilization can be lower than with a central queue, since stealing uses
/// an optimistic strategy and is a best-effort operation. When task runtimes
/// are long, work stealing can be more efficient than central queueing.
///
/// This reduced contention is particularly beneficial in dynamic environments
/// with significantly fluctuating workloads, enabling faster task completion
/// as workers can quickly adapt to take on shorter or less complex tasks as
/// they become available.
