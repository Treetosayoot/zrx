/// Work-sharing execution strategy.
///
/// This strategy manages its tasks centrally in a single bounded [`crossbeam`]
/// channel, which pull tasks from it and execute them, repeating the process
/// until they are terminated. This is a very simple, yet reasonably efficient
/// strategy in most cases.
///
/// Tasks are processed in the exact same order they were submitted, albeit they
/// might not finish in the same order. As this strategy uses a bounded channel,
/// task submission might fail when the channel's capacity is reached, leading
/// to better performance characteristics due to the use of atomics over locks.
/// As an alternative, the [`WorkStealing`][] strategy can be used, which is
/// built on unbounded channels and allows for more flexible task submission,
/// including automatic load balancing between workers which is particularly
/// useful when tasks create subtasks.
///
/// [`WorkStealing`]: crate::executor::strategy::WorkStealing
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// # use std::error::Error;
/// # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
/// use zrx_executor::strategy::{Strategy, WorkSharing};
///
/// // Create strategy and submit task
/// let strategy = WorkSharing::default();
/// strategy.submit(Box::new(|| println!("Task")))?;
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
