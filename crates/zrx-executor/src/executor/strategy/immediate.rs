/// Immediate execution strategy.
///
/// This strategy executes a given task immediately, and is primarily intended
/// for testing and debugging purposes. No threading is involved, which makes
/// it much easier to reason about execution order. Additionally, it can act
/// as a baseline for comparison with worker-based strategies.
///
/// __Warning__: When channels are involved, this strategy might deadlock, i.e.,
/// when a task from a worker thread tries to send on a bounded channel that is
/// full. In this case, make sure to either use unbounded channels, or actively
/// drain the channel before sending on it.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// # use std::error::Error;
/// # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
/// use zrx_executor::strategy::{Immediate, Strategy};
///
/// // Create strategy and submit task
/// let strategy = Immediate::default();
/// strategy.submit(Box::new(|| println!("Task")))?;
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
/// ```
