/// Topological traversal.
///
/// This data type manages a topological traversal of a directed acyclic graph
/// (DAG). It allows visiting nodes in a way that respects their dependencies,
/// meaning that a node can only be visited after all of its dependencies have
/// been visited. Visitable nodes can be obtained with [`Traversal::take`].
///
/// Note that the traversal itself doesn't know whether it's complete or not,
/// as it only tracks visitable nodes depending on what has been reported back
/// to [`Traversal::complete`]. This is because we also need to support partial
/// traversals that can be resumed, which must be managed by the caller. In case
/// a traversal starts at an intermediate node, only the nodes and dependencies
/// reachable from this node are considered, which is necessary for implementing
/// subgraph traversals that are self-contained, allowing for the creation of
/// frontiers at any point in the graph.
